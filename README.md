# Abstract
In recent years, there has been a notable surge in interest surrounding blockchain advancements. While currency exchange is a prominent topic of discussion, its applicability extends beyond digital currency alone. This technology holds the potential to impact various industries, offering increased transparency and facilitating smoother large-scale transactions. Blockchain also serves as a tool to identify fake products, addressing a prevalent concern in today's market. The widespread presence of counterfeit goods has significant repercussions on economic development. Thus, it is crucial to provide consumers with transparent information about the authenticity of products. The escalating prevalence of unsafe and counterfeit items worldwide is a worrisome issue, and blockchain technology represents a significant stride towards eradicating it entirely. Implementing this technology not only diminishes the production of fake goods but also necessitates widespread awareness. Each legitimate item should be assigned a unique digital code during production and packaging. This code can be scanned using specialized software, enabling verification of the product's authenticity.
